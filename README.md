Telecom Churn Analysis Dashboard <br>
Tools: Python | Power BI | SQL<br>

Project Overview<br>
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer churn. Using SQL for data cleaning, Python for predictive modeling, and Power BI for visualization, the dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior, churn rate, and forecasts of future churn.
<br> 

Key Features<br>
Data Analysis & Cleaning <br> Cleaned and processed the telecom dataset using SQL, creating view tables to optimize data extraction.
<br>

Dashboard Development <br> Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard, visualizing key metrics such as:
    • Total Customers: 6,000 <br>     • Churn Rate: 26.9%
<br>

Predictive Modeling <br> Implemented a Random Forest algorithm in Python, achieving an 83% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.
<br>

Integration with Power BI <br> Integrated predictive results into the dashboard to forecast churn for new joiners, enabling data-driven decision-making.
<br>

Technologies Used
SQL: Data cleaning and table creation. <br>
Python: Machine learning model development. <br>
Power BI: Dashboard creation and visualization. <br>
