Telecom Churn Analysis Dashboard
Tools: Python | Power BI | SQL
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer churn. Using SQL for data cleaning, Python for predictive modeling, and Power BI for visualization, the dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior, churn rate, and forecasts of future churn.


Key Features
Data Analysis & Cleaning
Cleaned and processed the telecom dataset using SQL, creating view tables to optimize data extraction.

Dashboard Development
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard, visualizing key metrics such as:

Total Customers: 6,000
Churn Rate: 26.9%
Predictive Modeling
Implemented a Random Forest algorithm in Python, achieving an 83% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.

Integration with Power BI
Integrated predictive results into the dashboard to forecast churn for new joiners, enabling data-driven decision-making.
